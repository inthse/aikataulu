# Aikataulu
a Finnish language webpage for easily keeping track of how long you've spent working from home each day

## Who is this for?
I made this for my spouse, but anyone working from home can benefit from this if you want a more precise way to log what times you started, took breaks, and stopped working, and count the total time.

## How is it used?
It's basically a fancy stopwatch. Press play (aloita) when you start working. Press pause when you take a break, then play when you continue. All of your breaks will be listed for review or deletion. Press stop (lopeta) when you're done for the day. If you pressed stop but actually kept working, no problem, just click the 'hups' button. If any of your times are incorrect, you can click on them to edit them and update your total time count.

The original plan was also to allow saving each day to a database for later retrieval, to see how many hours you've worked each week, month, etc. This feature isn't available yet but could be in the future, if resources permit.
